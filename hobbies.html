<h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Painting</li>
      <p align="justify">Every one of us has some kind of liking/ disliking for certain
things in life. Similarly I love drawing because drawing do not cost much and
is always fun. Drawing is my favorite hobby.
I cannot imagine a colorful life without drawing.</p>
      <li>Cardriving</li>
      <p align="justify">Call me crazy, weird, boring, and the like (most of those are probably true), but there is nothing better than driving down a new road while listening to my favorite Jesus music. You cannot convince me of anything more fun. Driving makes me feel closer to God in many different ways. I'm so thankful that I live in the 21st century (and that my parents let me borrow their cars). I shall now proceed to list the 5 amazing reasons why driving helps me feel closer to God. (Lowkey crying right now because DRIVING IS MY FAVORITE AND I JUST WANT TO DRIVE ALL THE TIME I THINK I MIGHT HAVE AN OBSESSION I'M NOT SURE). </p>
      <li>Cricket</li>
      <p align="justify">A hobby, whatever it may be is definitely a fun activity and a stress buster. There are so many activities people do in their free time and to relax their stressed mind. The common and popular hobbies are Stamp and coin collection, music, painting, photography, reading and cooking. Among long, long list of various hobby activities, there is one interesting, informative and adventurous hobby which is also one of the most popular and loved pastimes. That is travelling.</p>
